The obvious solution - put all formulas into Excel sheet to understand how progress will look like.

Clicker heroes (and it's clones) use this simple formula:

Monster HP doubles every 5 levels, item cost is balanced to limit DPS increase at about 0.9 of HP increase. The difference stacks exponentially and very soon you hit a point where it takes ages to buy the next dps upgrade.

That's pretty much where you are supposed to ascent, buy upgrades with ascension currency and start playing again just to hit another wall. Pretty fun concept.
