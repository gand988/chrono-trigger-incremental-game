Found a way to have a good DPS. 'setInterval' will be 1 second all the time and
maybe sometimes it can change the speed. Trovare una soluzione per visualizzare
i numeri che cambiano per cifra intera e non intervallo

Added: 
  kill count in stats

[14/08/2022] ---- 

Createa new js file to remove useles stuff and make order on the things that
i've done. 

[15/08/2022] ---- 

Today I learn that you can add /** */ before a function or a
variable on js files and you can add a documentation. So when you hover the
function/variable it will popup the Docs 

  + New documentation before most of the functions 
    note: it's important to have a good documentation for future review and for different people to work on.

[17/08/2022] ----

  Fixed:
